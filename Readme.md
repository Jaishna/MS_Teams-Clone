# MS TEAMS CLONE

A video and chat application based on the functionality of MS Teams. It is a platform on which people can talk in real time using the web. It uses the Socket.io Javascript library to build the skeleton of the project.

More on Socket.io:
_It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API. Like Node.js, it is event-driven.
_

This project is submitted as part of the Submission Phase of **Microsoft Engage 2021.**
